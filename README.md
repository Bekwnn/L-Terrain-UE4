# L-Terrain-UE4

An unreal engine plugin for generating semi-procedural landscapes. Uses input into a 2D tile editor to generate the final terrain.
The 2D tile editor allows you to work at different LoDs, using a grammar "rule editor" to generate successively higher detail
tile maps with reduced effort.

Designed as an experimental method for landscape creation, with the intention of speeding up the creation process. The Generated
landscape can then be further modified using traditional in-engine tools.
